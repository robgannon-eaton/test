# Welcome to our Documentation Site

This is where we be creating all our documentation for the DDS project.  For the purposes of the workshop, we will each be creating an about me page for the teams document.  Something a bit of fun to practice using markdown and creating our own content.  

## Before the workshop

Before attending the workshop, please have the [set up your environment](tutorial\set-up-your-environment.md) section complete.  If you have any issues, please reach out to one of the developers. 

You may also like to have a photo or two available to be able to put on your page.

## Steps to complete the workshop
Please use the tutorial to 
  - get the latest changes from git
  - create a new branch
  - create a page for yourself, please include
    - different headings
    - some text formatting
    - some images
    - a list or two
    - at least one link
  - push your changes to GitHub and create a pull request.
